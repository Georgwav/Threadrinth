## What's different

### 🧩 CurseForge and Feed the Beast

Install CurseForge mods and CurseForge or FTB modpacks from their own tab.

### 🖥️ Host any instance as a server

One click, only the server-side mods, with a console and stats. Friends join through [playit.gg](https://playit.gg) or port forwarding.

### 🎨 Themes

Ember, Sand, Orchid, Amethyst and Blossom, plus any accent color.

- **Instance folders just work:** drop one in and click **Refresh**, like in Prism Launcher.
- **Brings your Modrinth App instances along** with their icons and playtime.
- **Works on Windows, macOS and Linux**, even with one shared instances folder.
- **Copy or move worlds** between instances and **export server packs**.
- **Skin history** of every skin you wear.
- **Updates itself** in one click.

## Install

**Windows** (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Georgwav/Threadrinth/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Linux:**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Georgwav/Threadrinth/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

**macOS:** download the `.dmg` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Georgwav/Threadrinth/releases/latest) (one app for Apple Silicon and Intel) and drag Threadrinth into Applications.

The Windows and Linux commands download the latest release, check it against its published checksum and install it. Run them again at any time to reinstall. You can also download the installers from the [releases page](https://github.com/Georgwav/Threadrinth/releases).

## Development

```sh
cp packages/app-lib/.env.prod packages/app-lib/.env
pnpm install
pnpm app:dev
```

Needs Node.js, pnpm, Rust and the [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/). The CurseForge tab needs a [CurseForge API key](https://console.curseforge.com/) in the `CURSEFORGE_API_KEY` environment variable (at build time, or when running); without one only Feed the Beast works there. `main` is protected, so open a pull request from a fork.

## Code signing policy

Windows and macOS releases are built by GitHub Actions from this repository. Only builds of `main` are signed.

- **Committers and reviewers:** [Georgwav](https://github.com/Georgwav)
- **Approvers:** [Georgwav](https://github.com/Georgwav)

Changes to `main` only land through pull requests.

**Privacy:** Threadrinth connects to Modrinth (mods and modpacks), Mojang and Microsoft (sign-in, game files, skins) and GitHub (app updates) to work, and to CurseForge, Feed the Beast and playit.gg only when you use those features. Modrinth's anonymous usage statistics are off by default and can be turned on in Settings → Privacy. Threadrinth itself collects nothing.

## License

GPL-3.0 like upstream; other packages keep their own licenses (see [COPYING.md](COPYING.md)). Modrinth's branding has been removed. The Threadrinth logo is original artwork.
